  <p style="text-align:center;"><b style="font-size: 40px;">Trial of Ly Tu</b></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Ly Tu was assigned by Emperor Qin to unify the text into one style and was also considered to be the foundation for calligraphy.</p>

  <p><b style="font-size: 30px;">Ly Tu</b> (李斯, 284 BC - 208 BC) was an ancient Chinese politician who served as prime minister under the reigns of Qin Shi Huang and Qin Er Shi. He was a man of great merit in the unification of vassals by Qin Shi Huang, turning China into a centralized monarchy, unified in writing, measurement and ideology.</p>
  <p><b style="font-size: 30px;">Background</b><br>
    Ly Tu is from Thuong Sai land of Chu country<br>
    He was born in the Warring States period<br>
    He and Han Phi were both students of Tuan Tu.<br>
    When he was young, he worked as a small mandarin in the district, was a secretary in the commune's clerical administration, and since then he has cultivated the will to do politics.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 30px;">Set up a career</b> 
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">In 247 BC, when he arrived in the Qin state, when he met the death of Qin Trang Tuong Vuong, Ly Tu asked to be a follower of Van Tin Hau La Bat Vi, the prime minister of the Tan state. Bat Vi is considered a sage who is used as the "Lang" mandarin. Because of that, Ly Tu had the opportunity to travel, and Qin Vuong Chinh made Tu the chief historian, and then the guest. Among the 3,000 "guests" of La Buwei, Ly Tu quickly became the most prominent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">In the ninth year of the 9th dynasty, through many events, Li Shu took power in his hands and changed his personality, and he harmed (Han Fei) causing his death. and this is also the historical tragedy of the times.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 30px;">Prime Minister of the Qin Dynasty (Li Tu)</b> 
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Tu is related to the family lieutenant. For more than 20 years, the Qin state annexed all of its vassal states and unified China. King Qin became emperor and made Ly Tu prime minister. The Qin Dynasty flattened the vassal castle, ordered the districts and districts to melt weapons, meaning they were no longer in use. Heeding Ly Tu's will, Qin Shi Huang did not give land to anyone, even if it was only a few feet long, did not establish a royal family as a king, and a public god as a vassal to avoid repeating the story of countries fighting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Through his words, Qin Shi Huang obeyed him and confiscated all the books of the Classics, the Classics, and the books of the Huns, leaving only the books of medicine, fortune-telling, and planting books, avoiding the use of old affairs. to consider this life. Ly Tu also helped the king to make laws, unify the literature, measure, build palaces and villas throughout the country, defeat the Xiongnu.</p>
 <p><b style="font-size: 30px;">His death</b>
 <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After doing anti-war, the emperor's power was due to treason. Ly Tu Một nămand his son were subjected to a torture called the "five punishments" that he invented[2] and the three of them were killed together, with their heads covered at the city gate. It was 208 BC, when he was about 60 years old.</p>
 <p style="text-indent: 50px;">A year after Ly Tu died, Trieu Cao forced Nhi The to commit suicide.[3] King Qin Tu Anh ascended the throne, killed Trieu Cao, then Luu Bang invaded Qin, captured Tu Anh, later Tu Anh was killed by Xiang Yu. The Qin Dynasty was destroyed.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 30px;">General comments about Mr</b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
 Ly Tu was born as a clothier in the village, traveled throughout the vassal countries, went to worship Qin, took advantage of the opportunity that other countries could take advantage of, so he helped Thuy Hoang make a career. Self-made three gongs, can be called high position and be respected. Tu knew the way of the six scriptures, but he did not worry about making himself clear to correct the king's shortcomings; On the contrary, he took care of keeping the title high, and having a good fortune, making his majesty more solemn, his punishment more cruel, listening to Cao's heresies, leaving the eldest son to establish a second son. It's not too late when the vassals have committed treason, then Tu wants to stop it, isn't it too late? People all think that Tu was loyal but died in five forms, but in the end, it was not like the common sayings of the world. If not, it turns out that Tu's work can be compared to that of Chu Cong and Thieu Cong.

                Calligraphy appeared almost simultaneously with the formation of the text by the need for elegant presentation and transparency of the text. The main tools that create calligraphy are the pen and the writing material, which is later understood to include (ink and paper). Calligraphers are often not necessarily intellectuals, but are more or less respected for having enough academic capital to transcribe.
                - Continents' vision for calligraphy
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                 In the Western world, calligraphers are often sages or priests because of the pragmatic nature of the signature form across the paper. and understood
                  “Calligraphy” is the ART OF BEAUTIFUL WRITE in general.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                 As for the Asian world, calligraphy is: calligraphy has a clear level of improvement, calligraphy is having at least once passed the exam or being respected for both talent and virtue. then these people consider their letters to be precious assets and only give them to those who are dear or respectful, the rest of the calligraphers, who have failed their exams, are not qualified to teach but are also looked down upon.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                 In post-modern Vietnam, due to the stigma as well as the interruption of the Chinese character culture[2], many people who claim to be calligraphers sell letters in the ancient style, but often violate the taboos of the scribes. Traditional painting: Unable to distinguish Chinese characters, do not know how to hold a pen, mix ink, even abuse Latin characters in Chinese calligraphy (because they themselves do not study Chinese characters seriously)... This class of people was ostracized by Han-Nom researchers.

    - Chinese characters have been used in Vietnam since at least 2000 years ago. The independent feudal and monarchy dynasties in Vietnam all considered Chinese characters, Chinese literature as the state administrative language, literary language...

Chinese characters have lost their unique position, giving way to the national language since the beginning of the 20th century, marked by the abolition of the entrance exam at the end of the Nguyen Dynasty. Although it is no longer respected as in the past, Chinese characters continue to be used by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North) and the Republic of Vietnam (South) in many official cases. Only after the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established (1976), especially after the Vietnam - China war took place (1979), did Chinese characters officially step out of the historical arena and gradually become a things "strange letters", assigned with many "strange" values.''
